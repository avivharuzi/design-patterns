# Observer

Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify mul­ti­ple objects about any events that hap­pen to the object they're observing.

## Examples

* [PHP](php)
* [Python](python)
* [TypeScript](typescript)

## How to Implement

1. Look over your business logic and try to break it down into two parts: the core functionality, independent from other code, will act as the publisher; the rest will turn into a set of sub­scriber classes.
2. Declare the sub­scriber inter­face. At a bare min­i­mum, it should declare a sin­gle update method.
3. Declare the publisher inter­face and describe a pair of meth­ods for adding a sub­scriber object to and removing it from the list. Remember that publishers must work with sub­scribers only via the sub­scriber interface.
4. Decide where to put the actual subscription list and the implementation of subscription meth­ods. Usu­al­ly, this code looks the same for all types of publishers, so the obvious place to put it is in an abstract class derived direct­ly from the publisher inter­face. Con­crete publishers extend that class, inheriting the subscription behavior.
5. Cre­ate con­crete publisher class­es. Each time some­thing important hap­pens inside a publisher, it must notify all its subscribers.
6. Implement the update notification meth­ods in con­crete sub­scriber class­es. Most sub­scribers would need some con­text data about the event. It can be passed as an argument of the notification method.
7. The client must cre­ate all necessary sub­scribers and reg­is­ter them with prop­er publishers.
